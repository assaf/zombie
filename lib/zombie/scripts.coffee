# HTML5 parser doesn't play well with JSDOM and inline scripts.  This methods
# adds proper inline script support.
#
# Basically, JSDOM listens on the script tag, waiting for
# DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument, at which point the script tag may have a src
# attribute (external) but no text content (internal), so in the later case it
# attempts to execute an empty string.
#
# OTOH when we listen to DOMNodeInserted event on the document, the script tag
# includes its full text content and we're able to evaluate it correctly.
addInlineScriptSupport = (document)->
  # Basically we're going to listen to new script tags as they are inserted into
  # the DOM and then queue them to be processed.  JSDOM does the same, but
  # listens on the script element itself, and someone the event it captures
  # doesn't have any of the script contents.
