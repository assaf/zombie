zombie.js-changelog(7) -- Changelog
===================================


## Version 2.0.0

`browser.tabs` replaces `browser.windows`. Is now an array so you can access a
tab directly (e.g. `browser.tabs[0]`), and also switch tabs more easily (e.g.
`browser.tabs.current = 0`).

`console.log`, `console.error` and friends now emit a `console` event from the
browser.  First argument is the output type (e.g. "log"), second is the
formatted text.

`console.error` and `console.assert` output to standard error (unless silent).

`browser.url` returns the URL of the current document.

New browser has no open window.  You need to call `visit`, `open` or set
`location`.

Brand new implementation of browser history, fixes the "two URLs, one window"
issue.

`browser.request` and `browser.response` return the request/response used for
the last top-most page load.  All other resources available from
`browser.resources`.  These replace `lastRequest` and `lastResponse`.

Added `browser.activeElement` (removed `browser.focus`) and support for
`autofocus` attribute.

Browser is now an `EventEmitter` so you can hook into it and instrument it.

The `wait` method now takes two optional parameters: options that determine how
long to wait and a callback. Options include `duration`, `function` and
`element`, the later completing when the element is found in the document.

The `wait` method's wait function now receives two parameters: the active window
and how long the wait is for the next event (0 to Infinity).

The `visit` method now passes applicable options to `wait` (`duration`,
`function`, etc).

The `maxWait` option is now called `waitDuration` and `waitFor` is no longer
supported. waitDuration should be provided in milliseconds (maxWait was provided in seconds)

Introducing assertsions to make your life all the more easier, for example:

  browser.element("h1")
  browser.text("h1", "Header")
  browser.elements("li", { atLeast: 5 })
  browser.assert.url("http://example.com")

Added support for deflat and gzip responses.

New API for accessing resources, use `browser.resources`.  Lots of goodies like
allowing you to retrieve resources directory (`resources.get`,
`resources.post`), define how resources are handled, emulate server failures
(`resources.fail`), delay responses (`resources.delay`), even mock responses
(`resources.mock`).

## Version 1.4.1 2012-08-22

Fixed another timer edge case.

    550 tests

## Version 1.4.0 2012-08-22

Support for browser custom headers ():

  browser.headers =
    "Accept-Language": "da, en-gb"

`browser.fork()` now copies browser options (Jakub Kulhan).

Fixed `window.close()` to properly dispose of the context, and added
`browser.close()` to properly close all windows and cleanup.  If you're running
into memory issues, use either method.

Share the same location instance between history stack entries (David Stendardi)

Do not down-case file: URLs.

Implemented `Node.contains` (Dave Dopson).

Setting `element.style.width` now reflected in value of `element.clientWidth`
and `element.offsetWidth` (and same for height).

Upgraded dependencies, tested with Node 0.8.6, jQuery 1.8.0, require.js 2.0.6.

Fail if Contextify module not available.

Fixed edge case where timers may fire after `browser.wait` returns.

## Version 1.3.0 2012-06-05

Note that `browser.text` now trims and strips consecutive whitespace.

value like "5s", "1m", etc.

Fixed `a.href` to not break when missing `href` attribute.

Fixed JS execution bug that messes with require.js.

Fixed failing to create empty document on HTTP error.

Reload document when forking browser.

Set `accept-encoding` to "identity".

`JSON.parse` now respects `Array.prototype`.

Implemented `window.resizeBy` and `window.resizeTo`.

If DOM attribute is not set, `getAttribute` will return `null` just like any
browser (though the spec insists on empty string).

Fix all file loading (document and resources) to use same code path.

    531 tests
    12.5 sec to complete


## Version 1.1.7 2012-05-27

Create DOM document after Web page has loaded.  If you want to set document
location and wait for document to load, so this:

  browser.location = url;
  browser.on("loaded", function() {
    // Called after document has loaded
    ...
  })

Remove 'Content Type' and 'Content Length' on redirect (re-fixed.)

    12.3 sec to complete


## Version 1.1.5 2012-05-24

The `wait` function (and its derivatives) now return most recent error in
callback.

To use promises and duration function, call `wait` with two arguments, second
one being `null`.

Workaround for the tricky `getElementById("foo").querySelector("#foo .bar")`
behavior that JSDOM doesn't get quite right.

    500 tests
    12.3 sec to complete


## Version 1.1.4 2012-05-22

Upgraded to HTML5 0.3.8.

    487 tests
    11.8 sec to complete


## Version 1.0.0 2012-05-10

Yes, that is right, Zombie now supports promises.  Like this:

    browser.visit("http://localhost:3000/").
      then(function() {
        assert.equal(browser.text("H1"), "Deferred zombies");
        // Chaining works by returning a promise here
        return browser.clickLink("Hit me");
      }).
      then(function() {
        assert.equal(browser.text("H1"), "Ouch");
      });

A new way to set authentication credentials so they can be applied to specific
host (e.g. HTTP Basic one host, OAuth Bearer another).  Like this:

    // HTTP Basic takes user and password
    browser.authenticate().basic("me", "secret")
    // OAuth 2.0 Bearer takes an access token
    browser.authenticate("example.com:443").bearer("12345")
    // Show the authentication credentials in use
    console.log(browser.authenticate().token)

Successfully testing Facebook Connect using Zombie (see
`test/facebook_connect_test.coffee`).

    487 tests
    12.1 sec to complete


## Version 0.13.14 2012-05-09

Changed browser option `windowName` to just `name.`

Setting browser option to `undefined` no longer resets it to default (that was a
stupid idea).

Support for opening link in specified target (named window, `_self`, `_parent`, `_top` or
`_blank`).

Fixed Zombie retaining multiple values for the same cookie (domain/path/key).

    485 tests
    11.9 sec to complete

Old-style event handlers (onclick, onsubmit, etc) now have access to event
through `window.event`.

Old-style event handlers can return false to prevent default behavior.

and `StorageEvent`.

    457 tests
    10.2 sec to complete

## Version 0.13.4 2012-05-01

Upgraded to JSDOM 0.2.14.  This includes an upgrade to Contextify which fixes an
edge case with JS scoping.  It also translates to 10% faster tests (On My
Machine).

But HTML processing is a bit more picky right now.

Methods like `visit` now pass error to the callback if they fail to load or
parse the page.  JavaScript execution errors are handled separately.

    436 tests
    8.0 sec to complete


## Version 0.13.3 2012-04-30

helped find a couple of skipped tests.

Added support for proxies by using the excellent [Request
module](https://github.com/mikeal/request)

Added File object in browser (Ian Young)

Added support for EventSource (see [Server-Sent Events](http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/))

## Version 0.12.14 2012-02-07

Fix redirect not passing the same headers again.

    412 tests
    6.4 sec to complete


## Version 0.12.13 2012-01-18

`Browser.fire` takes no options (that was an undocumented argument), and always fires events that bubble and can be
cancelled.

Clicking on checkbox or radio button now changes the value and propagated the click event.  If `preventDefault`, the
value is changed back.

    411 tests
    6.0 sec to complete


## Version 0.12.12 2012-01-16

Added element offset properties.  Google Maps demand these.

    388 tests
    3.8 sec to complete


## Version 0.12.9 2011-12-23

Added support for `httpOnly` cookies.

You can now call `browser.cookies` with no arguments to return cookies for the current domain (based on the hostname of
the currently loaded page).

You can now pass `referer` header:

    browser.visit("/page", referer: "http://google.com", function() {
      . . .
    })

Apply 5 second time limit on `browser.wait`, even if there's something going on (e.g. pull requests).

    387 tests
    3.9 sec to complete


## Version 0.12.8 2011-12-20

Browser implementations of clearInterval/clearTimeout do not throw exceptions (Justin Tulloss)

Fix resources.toString throwing an error (Mr Rogers)

    374 tests
    3.9 sec to complete


## Version 0.12.7 2011-12-19

Methods like `visit` and `fire` no longer call `wait` if there's no callback.

The wait callback is called from `nextTick`.  Fixes a possible race condition.

    366 Tests
    3.7 sec to complete


## Version 0.12.6 2011-12-18

You can now tell `browser.wait` when to complete processing events by passing either duration (in milliseconds) or a
function that returns true when done.  For example:

    browser.wait(500, function() {
      // Waits no longer than 0.5 second
    })

    function mapIsVisible(window) {
      return window.querySelector("#map");
    }
    browser.wait(mapIsVisible, function() {
      // Waits until the map element is visible on the page
    })

Reduced default `waitFor` from 5 seconds to 0.5 seconds.  That seems good enough default for most pages.

    366 Tests
    3.7 sec to complete


## Version 0.12.5 2011-12-16

`Zombie` and `Browser` are no longer distinct namespaces.  What you require is the `Browser` class that also includes
all the methods previously defined for `Zombie`.  For example:

    var Browser = require("zombie")

    // This setting applies to all browsers
    Browser.debug = true
    // Create and use a new browser instance
    var browser = new Browser()
    browser.visit("http://localhost:3001", function() {
      ...
    })

Added `browser.history` for accessing history for the current window, `browser.back` for navigating to the previous page
and `browser.reload` for reloading the current page.

Fixed a bug whereby navigating back in push-state history would reload document.

    363 Tests
    2.4 sec to complete


## Version 0.12.4 2011-12-16

Return undefined for response status when there is no response.

    362 Tests
    2.4 sec to complete


## Version 0.12.3 2011-12-13

Fixed issue when globally declared variables with no values are not accessible (Brian McDaniel)

    362 Tests
    2.6 sec to complete


## Version 0.12.2 2011-12-12

Added global options, for example:

    Zombie.site = "http://localhost:3003"
    Zombie.visit("/browser/test", function() {
      ...
    })

You can put Zombie in debug mode by setting environment variable `DEBUG`, for example:

    $ DEBUG=true vows

Also added `silent` option to suppress all `console.log` output from scripts.

Support origin in websockets (Glen Mailer)

Proper support for CSS style `opacity` property.

    360 Tests
    2.5 sec to complete


## Version 0.12.1 2011-12-06

Added `browser.success`, returns true if status code is 2xx.

Updated documentation to better reflect new API features and behaviors.  Catching up on the many changes since 0.11.

DOM events now dispatched asynchronously as part of event loop.

Allow `//<hostname>` URLs to be used in more places

    359 Tests
    2.4 sec to complete


## Version 0.12.0 2011-12-06

Zombie is now using real timers instead of the fake clock.  That means that a `setTimeout(fn, 5000)` will actually take
5 seconds to complete.

The `wait` method will wait for short timers (up to 5 seconds), which are quite common for some UI effects, setting up
the page, etc.  The maximum wait time is specified by the browser option `waitFor`.

If you need to wait longer, you can call `wait` with a time duration as the first argument.

Log redirect and error responses in debug mode.

    353 Tests
    2.4 sec to complete


## Version 0.11.8 2011-12-04

Added `browser.query` and `browser.queryAll`. Deprecated `browser.css`;
planning to use it for something else post 1.0.

Calling `html` or `text` when the document is not an HTML page returns
the text contents.  Particularly useful if you're looking at the
contents of what should be an HTML page, but got 404 or 500 insteas.

    357 Tests
    2.0 sec to complete


## Version 0.11.7 2011-11-30

Fixed `console.log` formatting `%s`, `%d` (Quang Van).

Fixed `viewInBrowser`.

Updated documentation to mention `browser.errors and
`browser.resources`, and that `cake watch` and `cake build` are no
longer necessary.

Fix to load cookies that contain equal signs and quotes in the value.

    347 Tests
    2.0 sec to complete


## Version 0.11.6 2011-11-27

Fixed loading of cookies/history from file, so empty lines are ignored.

Show JavaScript source location when failing to execute in script element.

Don't execute timer/interval that has been removed.

    347 Tests
    2.2 sec to complete


## Version 0.11.2  2011-11-22

Send Content-Length in URL-encoded form requests (Sven Bange).

Added support for HTTP Basic and OAuth 2.0 authorization (Paul Dixon).

    344 Tests
    1.9 sec to complete


## Version 0.11.1  2011-11-21

Better error reporting when executing JS asynchronoulsy (timers, XHR).

Event loop keeps processing past errors.

    333 Tests
    1.8 sec to complete


## Version 0.11.0  2011-11-20

Changed error handling for the better.
    
Calling browser.wait or browser.visit no longer passed the
resource/JavaScript error as the first argument, and will continue
processing if there are multiple errors.
    
Instead, an array of errors is passed as the fourth argument.  You can
also access `browser.errors` and to get just the last one, e.g.  to
check if any errors were reported, use `browser.error`.


Using `console.log(browser)` will puke over your terminal, so we add
global defaults for sanity.

Set `console.depth` to specify how many times to recurse while
formatting the object (default is zero).

Set `console.showHidden` to show non-enumerable properties (defaults to
false).


    333 Tests
    1.7 sec to complete


## Version 0.10.3  2011-11-18

Added site option allowing you to call `visit` with a relative path.
Example:

    browser = new Browser(site: "localhost:3000")
    browser.visit("/testing", function(error, browser) {
    })

Fixed uploading of attachments to work with Connect/Express (and
possibly other servers).  Formidable (used by Connect) does not support
Base64 encoding.  Sending binary instead.

Tested on Node 0.6.1.

### Version 0.10.2  2011-10-13

Fixed #173 browser.open() causes Segmentation fault (Brian McDaniel)

Upgraded to JSDOM 0.2.7.


### Version 0.10.1  2011-09-08

Tests that this == window == top == parent.  True when evaluated within
the context of the browser, not necessarily when using browser.window.

Removed JSDOM patch for iframes, no tests failing, let's see what
happens ...

Fixes #164 jQuery selectors with explicit context fail.

Better stack traces for client-side JS.  This will help in debugging and
filing issues.
    
Updated installation instructions for OS X/Windows.

Upgraded to JSDOM 0.2.4 and testing with jQuery 1.6.3.

    329 Tests
    2.9 sec to complete


### Version 0.10.0  2011-08-27

Upgraded to [JSDOM](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) 0.2.3 which brings
us a Window context that works for asynchronous invocations (that would
be timers, XHR and browser.evaluate), and many many other improvements.

Tested for compatibility with jQuery 1.6.2.  Yes.  It works.


*NOTE*: This release uses
[htmlparser](https://github.com/gmosx/htmlparser) as the default parser,
while waiting for some bug fixes on
[HTML5](https://github.com/aredridel/html5).  Unfortunately, htmlparser
is limited in what it can accept and properly parse.  Be aware of the
following issues:

- Your document *must* have `html`, `head` and `body` elements.
- No CDATAs. But then again, CDATA is so 1999.
- Tag soups break the parser.
- Scripts can't use `document.write`.  Again, it's not 1999.


Added `browser.loadCSS` option.  Set this to load external stylesheets.
Defaults to `true`.

Added `browser.htmlParser` option.  Tells JSDOM which HTML5 parser to
use.  Use `null` for the default parser.

Fixed handling of `file` protocol.

speaking, each window gets it's own context/global scope that is shared
by all scripts loaded for that page, but isolated from all other
windows.

Fixes error handling on timeout/XHR scripts, these now generate an
`onerror` event.

Eventloop is now associated with window instead of browser.

Fixes URL resolution in XHR requests with no port.

### Version 0.8.12  2011-02-01

Tested with Node 0.3.7 in preparation for Node 0.4.0.

Added `browser.fork` (Josh Adell):

> Return a new browser using a snapshot of this browser's state.  This
method clones the forked browser's cookies, history and storage.  The
two browsers are independent, actions you perform in one browser do not
affect the other.

> Particularly useful for constructing a state (e.g.  sign in, add items
to a shopping cart) and using that as the base for multiple tests, and
for running parallel tests in Vows.

Fix firing the `change` event on `SELECT` elements when using jQuery
(Damian Janowski).

Fix for `jQuery.ajax` receiving a non-string `data` option (Damian
Janowski).

Fix to allow `script` elements that are not JavaScript (Sean Coates).

NOTE: In this release I started running the test suite using `cake test`
and recording the time reported by Vows.  This doesn't count the
time it takes to fire up Node, Cake, etc, so the reported time is
approximately a second smaller than the previously reported time for
0.8.11.  All other things being equal.

Modified `lastRequest`/`lastResponse` to use the window resources, fixed
`browser.status` and `browser.redirected` to only look at the page
resource itself.

Added accessors for status code from last respone (`browser.statusCode`)
and whether last response followed a redirect (`browser.redirected`)
(Assaf Arkin).

The `visit`, `clickLink` and `pressButton` methods now pass three
arguments to the callback: error, browser and status code (Assaf Arkin).

### Version 0.8.1  2010-12-29

Added User-Agent string.  You can change it by setting the browser
option `userAgent`.

There was an error with `browser.location`: documentation said it
returns a `Location` object but also just a URL.  Since `Location`
object is more consistent with `window.location`, accepted that
interpretation.

`Location.assign` did not load a page if the page was already loaded
in the browser.  Changed it to load the page (add caching later on).

### Version 0.8.0  2010-12-29

Fixed issue 8, wrong location of package.json.

Upgraded to JSDOM 0.1.22 and using HTML5 parser throughout.

Added browser.runScript option.  Set to false if you don't want the
browser to execute scripts.

You can now set browser options when initializing a new browser, on
existing `Browser` object or for the duration of a request by passing
them as second argument to `visit`.

Browser now has a property called `debug` that you can set to true/false
(was a function), and separately a method called `log` that logs
messages when debugging is enabled.

Added new page covering the browser API.

### Version 0.7.6  2010-12-28

HTML5 doesn't play nice with JSDOM, bringing back html-parser to handle
innerHTML (full document parsing still handled by HTML5).

Added documentation page for CSS selectors.

Man pages now moved to section 7.

Added zombie.version.

### Version 0.7.3  2010-12-27

Fixed non-sensical error message when selector fails matching a node
(`fill`, `check`, `select`, etc).

Added debugging to help you figure out what's happening when tests run:
- Call `browser.debug` with a boolean to turn debugging on/off.
- Call `browser.debug` with a boolean and function to turn debugging
  on/off only while calling that function.
- Call `browser.debug` with multiple arguments to print them (same as
  `console.log`).
- Call `browser.debug` with a function to print the result of that
  function call.

Added an all revealing browser.dump: history, cookies, storage,
document, etc.  Simply call:
    browser.dump

Testing that Zombie.js can handle jQuery live form submit event.  Yes it
can!

### Version 0.7.2  2010-12-27

In CoffeeScript 1.0 loops no longer try preserve block scope when
functions are being generated within the loop body.  Unfortunately, this
broke a bunch of stuff when running Zombie from CoffeeScript source.  It
had effect when running the compiled JavaScript.

Changed: window.location now returns the same Location object until you
navigate to a different page.

### Version 0.7.1  2010-12-22

Removed CoffeeScript from runtime dependency list.


### Version 0.7.0  2010-12-22

Added `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll` based on the [DOM Selector
API](http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-api/).  Use this instead of `find`
method.

Browser is now an EventEmitter, you can listen to drain (event queue
empty), error (loading page) and loaded (what is says).

You can now use `pressButton` with inputs of type button and reset
(previously just submit).

More, better, documentation.

sizzle.js from dep to vendor.  Moved scripts used during tests to
spec/.scripts.

### Version 0.6.1  2010-12-20

Changed browser.cookies from getter to function that accepts cookie domain
(host and port) and path, and returns wrapper to access specific cookie
context.

Fixed: browser now creates new window for each new document.

Added window.JSON.

### Version 0.6.0  2010-12-20

First release that I could use to test an existing project.

content using Sizzle. Browser features include evaluating JavaScript (jQuery,
Sammy.js), timers, XHR, cookies, local and session storage.

Still very rough around the edges.
