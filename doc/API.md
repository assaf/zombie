zombie.js-api(7) -- The Zombie API
==================================


## The Browser

### new zombie.Browser(options?) : Browser

Creates and returns a new browser.  A browser maintains state across requests: history, cookies, HTML 5 local and
session stroage.  A browser has a main window, and typically a document loaded into that window.

You can pass options when initializing a new browser, for example:

    var Browser = require("zombie")

    var browser = new Browser({ debug: true })
    browser.runScripts = false

Or on existing browser for the duration of a page load:

    Browser.visit("http://localhost:3000/", { debug: true, runScripts: false },
                 function (e, browser, status) {
      ...
    });

You can also set options globally for all browsers to inherit:

    Browser.site = "http://localhost:3000"
    Browser.loadCSS = false


### Browser Options

You can use the following options:

- `credentials` -- Object containing authorization credentials.
- `debug` -- Have Zombie report what it's doing.  Defaults to true if environment variable `DEBUG` is set.
- `loadCSS` -- Loads external stylesheets.  Defaults to true.
- `runScripts` -- Run scripts included in or loaded from the page.  Defaults to true.
- `userAgent` -- The User-Agent string to send to the server.
- `silent` -- If true, supress all `console.log` output from scripts.  You can still view it with `window.console.output`.
- `site` -- Base URL for all requests.  If set, you can call `visit` with relative URL.
- `waitFor` -- Tells `wait` function how long to wait (in milliseconds) while timers fire.  Defaults to 0.5 seconds.
- `windowName` -- Sets the browser's window.name property; useful when an evaluated script tries to detect whether/where the window is embedded as an iframe. Defaults to "nodejs".

Credential options look like this:

    { credentials: { scheme: "basic", username: "who", password: "secret" } } // HTTP Basic
    { credentials: { scheme: "oauth", token: "long and magical" } }   // OAuth 2.0 draft 10
    { credentials: { scheme: "bearer", token: "long and magical" } }  // OAuth 2.0 latest


### browser.visit(url, callback)
### browser.visit(url, options, callback)

Shortcut for creating new browser and calling `browser.visit` on it.  If the second argument are options, initializes
the browser with these options.  See *Navigation* below for more information about the `visit` method.

### browser.open() : Window
 
Opens a new browser window.

### browser.window : Window

Returns the main window.  A browser always has one window open.

### browser.error : Error

Returns the last error reported while loading this window.

### browser.errors : Array

Returns all errors reported while loading this window.


## Document Content

You can inspect the document content using the [DOM API](http://www.w3.org/DOM/DOMTR) traversal methods or the [DOM
Selector API](http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-api/).

To find an element with ID "item-23":

    var item = document.getElementById("item-23");

For example, to find out the first input field with the name "email":

    var field = document.querySelector(":input[name=email]");

To find out all the even rows in a table:

    var rows = table.querySelectorAll("tr:even");

CSS selectors support is provied by [Sizzle.js](https://github.com/jeresig/sizzle/wiki), the same engine used by jQuery.
You're probably familiar with it, if not, check the [list of supported selectors](selectors).

### browser.body : Element

Returns the body element of the current document.

### browser.document : Document

Returns the main window's document.  Only valid after opening a document (see `browser.visit`).

### browser.evaluate(expr) : Object

Evaluates a JavaScript expression in the context of the current window and returns the result.  For example:

    browser.evaluate("document.title");

### browser.html(selector?, context?) : String

Returns the HTML contents of the selected elements.

With no arguments returns the HTML contents of the document.  This is one way to find out what the page looks like after
executing a bunch of JavaScript.

With one argument, the first argument is a CSS selector evaluated against the document body.  With two arguments, the
CSS selector is evaluated against the element given as the context.

For example:

    console.log(browser.html("#main"));

### browser.queryAll(selector, context?) : Array

Evaluates the CSS selector against the document (or context node) and return array of nodes.  (Unlike
`document.querySelectorAll` that returns a node list).

### browser.query(selector, context?) : Element

Evaluates the CSS selector against the document (or context node) and return an element.

### browser.text(selector, context?) : String

Returns the text contents of the selected elements.

With one argument, the first argument is a CSS selector evaluated against the document body.  With two arguments, the
CSS selector is evaluated against the element given as the context.

For example:

    console.log(browser.text("title"));

### browser.xpath(expression, context?) : XPathResult

Evaluates the XPath expression against the document (or context node) and return the XPath result.  Shortcut for
`document.evaluate`.


## Navigation

Zombie.js loads pages asynchronously.  In addition, a page may require loading additional resources (such as JavaScript
files) and executing various event handlers (e.g. `jQuery.onready`).

For that reason, navigating to a new page doesn't land you immediately on that page: you have to wait for the browser to
complete processing of all events.  You can do that by calling `browser.wait` or passing a callback to methods like
`visit` and `clickLink.`

### browser.back(callback)

Navigate to the previous page in history.

### browser.clickLink(selector, callback)
 
Clicks on a link.  The first argument is the link text or CSS selector.  Second argument is a callback, invoked after
all events are allowed to run their course.

Zombie.js fires a `click` event and has a default event handler that will to the link's `href` value, just like a
browser would.  However, event handlers may intercept the event and do other things, just like a real browser.

For example:

    browser.clickLink("View Cart", function(e, browser, status) {
      assert.lengthOf(browser.queryAll("#cart .body"), 3);
    });

### browser.history : History

Returns the history of the current window (same as `window.history`).

### browser.link(selector) : Element

Finds and returns a link (`A`) element.  You can use a CSS selector or find a link by its text contents (case sensitive,
but ignores leading/trailing spaces). 

### browser.location : Location

Return the location of the current document (same as `window.location`).

### browser.location = url

Changes document location, loading a new document if necessary (same as setting `window.location`).  This will also work
if you just need to change the hash (Zombie.js will fire a `hashchange` event), for example:

    browser.location = "#bang";
    browser.wait(function(e, browser) {
      // Fired hashchange event and did something cool.
      ...
    });

### browser.reload(callback)

Reloads the current page.

### browser.statusCode : Number

Returns the status code returned for this page request (200, 303, etc).

### browser.success : Boolean

Returns true if the status code is 2xx.

### browser.visit(url, callback)
### browser.visit(url, options, callback)

Loads document from the specified URL, processes all events in the queue, and finally invokes the callback.

In the second form, sets the options for the duration of the request, and resets before passing control to the callback.
For example:

    browser.visit("http://localhost:3000", { debug: true },
      function(e, browser, status) {
        console.log("The page:", browser.html());
      }
    );

### browser.redirected : Boolean

Returns true if the page request followed a redirect.
    

## Forms

Methods for interacting with form controls (e.g. `fill`, `check`) take a first argument that tries to identify the form
control using a variety of approaches.  You can always select the form control using an appropriate [CSS
selector](selectors), or pass the element itself.

Zombie.js can also identify form controls using their name (the value of the `name` attribute) or using the text of the
label associated with that control.  In both case, the comparison is case sensitive, but to work flawlessly, ignores
leading/trailing whitespaces when looking at labels.

If there are no event handlers, Zombie.js will submit the form just like a browser would, process the response
(including any redirects) and transfer control to the callback function when done.

If there are event handlers, they will all be run before transferring control to the callback function.  Zombie.js can
even support jQuery live event handlers.

### browser.attach(selector, filename, callback) : this

Attaches a file to the specified input field.  The second argument is the file name (you cannot attach streams).

Without callback, returns this.

### browser.check(field, callback) : this
 
Checks a checkbox.  The argument can be the field name, label text or a CSS selector.

Without callback, returns this.

### browser.choose(field, callback) : this

Selects a radio box option.  The argument can be the field name, label text or a CSS selector.

Without callback, returns this.

### browser.field(selector) : Element

Find and return an input field (`INPUT`, `TEXTAREA` or `SELECT`) based on a CSS selector, field name (its `name`
attribute) or the text value of a label associated with that field (case sensitive, but ignores leading/trailing
spaces).

### browser.fill(field, value, callback) : this

Fill in a field: input field or text area.  The first argument can be the field name, label text or a CSS selector.  The
second argument is the field value.

For example:

    browser.fill("Name", "ArmBiter").fill("Password", "Brains...")

Without callback, returns this.

### browser.button(selector) : Element

Finds a button using CSS selector, button name or button text (`BUTTON` or `INPUT` element).

### browser.pressButton(selector, callback)
 
Press a button.  Typically this will submit the form, but may also reset the form or simulate a click, depending on the
button type.

The first argument is either the button name, text value or CSS selector.  Second argument is a callback, invoked after
the button is pressed, form submitted and all events allowed to run their course.

For example:

    browser.fill("email", "zombie@underworld.dead").
      pressButton("Sign me Up", function() {
        // All signed up, now what?
      });

Returns nothing.

### browser.select(field, value, callback) : this
 
Selects an option.  The first argument can be the field name, label text or a CSS selector.  The second value is the
option to select, by value or label.

For example:

    browser.select("Currency", "brains")

See also `selectOption`.

Without callback, returns this.

### browser.selectOption(option, callback) : this

Selects the option (an `OPTION` element).

Without callback, returns this.

### browser.uncheck(field, callback) : this

Unchecks a checkbox.  The argument can be the field name, label text or a CSS selector.

Without callback, returns this.

### browser.unselect(field, value, callback) : this
 
Unselects an option.  The first argument can be the field name, label text or a CSS selector.  The second value is the
option to unselect, by value or label.

You can use this (or `unselectOption`) when dealing with multiple selection.

Without callback, returns this.

### browser.unselectOption(option, callback) : this

Unselects the option (an `OPTION` element).

Without callback, returns this.


## State Management

The browser maintains state as you navigate from one page to another.  Zombie.js supports both
[cookies](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2109.txt) and HTML5 [Web Storage](http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/).

Note that Web storage is specific to a host/port combination.  Cookie storage is specific to a domain, typically a host,
ignoring the port.

### browser.cookies(domain?, path?) : Cookies

Returns all the cookies for this domain/path.  Without domain, uses the hostname of the currently loaded page.  Without
path, uses the pathname of the currently loaded page.

For example:

    browser.cookies().set("session", "123");
    browser.cookies("host.example.com", "/path").set("onlyhere", "567");

The `Cookies` object has the methods `all()`, `clear()`, `get(name)`, `set(name, value)`, `remove(name)` and `dump()`.

The `set` method accepts a third argument which may include the options `expires`, `maxAge`, `httpOnly` and `secure`.

### browser.fork() : Browser

Return a new browser using a snapshot of this browser's state.  This method clones the forked browser's cookies, history
and storage.  The two browsers are independent, actions you perform in one browser do not affect the other.

Particularly useful for constructing a state (e.g.  sign in, add items to a shopping cart) and using that as the base
for multiple tests, and for running parallel tests in Vows.

### browser.loadCookies(String)

Load cookies from a text string (e.g. previously created using `browser.saveCookies`.

### browser.loadHistory(String)

Load history from a text string (e.g. previously created using `browser.saveHistory`.

### browser.loadStorage(String)

Load local/session stroage from a text string (e.g. previously created using `browser.saveStorage`.

### browser.localStorage(host) : Storage
    
Returns local Storage based on the document origin (hostname/port).

For example:

    browser.localStorage("localhost:3000").setItem("session", "567");

The `Storage` object has the methods `key(index)`, `getItem(name)`, `setItem(name, value)`, `removeItem(name)`,
`clear()` and `dump`.  It also has the read-only property `length`.

### browser.saveCookies() : String

Save cookies to a text string.  You can use this to load them back later on using `browser.loadCookies`.

### browser.saveHistory() : String

Save history to a text string.  You can use this to load the data later on using `browser.loadHistory`.

### browser.saveStorage() : String

Save local/session storage to a text string.  You can use this to load the data later on using `browser.loadStorage`.

### browser.sessionStorage(host) : Storage

Returns session Storage based on the document origin (hostname/port).  See `localStorage` above.


## Interaction
 
### browser.onalert(fn)

Called by `window.alert` with the message.  If you just want to know if an alert was shown, you can also use `prompted`
(see below).

### browser.onconfirm(question, response)
### browser.onconfirm(fn)

The first form specifies a canned response to return when `window.confirm` is called with that question.  The second
form will call the function with the question and use the respone of the first function to return a value (true or
false).

The response to the question can be true or false, so all canned responses are converted to either value.  If no
response available, returns false.

For example:

    browser.onconfirm("Are you sure?", true)

### browser.onprompt(message, response)
### browser.onprompt(fn)

The first form specifies a canned response to return when `window.prompt` is called with that message.  The second form
will call the function with the message and default value and use the response of the first function to return a value
or false.

The response to a prompt can be any value (converted to a string), false to indicate the user cancelled the prompt
(returning null), or nothing to have the prompt return the default value or an empty string.

For example:

    browser.onprompt(function(message) { return Math.random() })

### browser.prompted(message) : boolean

Returns true if user was prompted with that message by a previous call to `window.alert`, `window.confirm` or
`window.prompt`.


## Events

Since events may execute asynchronously (e.g. XHR requests, timers), the browser maintains an event queue.  Occasionally
you will need to let the browser execute all the queued events before proceeding.  This is done by calling `wait`, or
one of the many methods that accept a callback.

In addition the browser is also an `EventEmitter`.  You can register any number of event listeners to any of the emitted
events.

### browser.fire(name, target, calback?)

Fires a DOM event.  You can use this to simulate a DOM event, e.g. clicking a link or clicking the mouse.  These events
will bubble up and can be cancelled.

The first argument it the event name (e.g. `click`), the second argument is the target element of the event.  With a
callback, this method will transfer control to the callback after running all events.

### browser.wait(callback)
### browser.wait(duration, callback)
### browser.wait(done, callback)

Waits for the browser to complete loading resources and processing JavaScript events.

The browser will wait for resources to load (scripts, iframes, etc), XHR requests to complete, DOM events to fire and
timers (timeout and interval).  But it can't wait forever, especially not for timers that may fire repeatedly (e.g.
checking page state, long polling).

There are two mechanisms to determine completion of processing.  You can tell the browser to give up after certain time
by passing the duration as first argument, or by setting the browser option `waitFor`.  The default value is 500, since
waiting 0.5 seconds is good enough for most pages.

You can also tell the browser to wait for something to happen on the page by passing a function as the first argument.
That function is called repeatedly with the window object, and should return true (or any value equal to true) when it's
time to pass control back to the application.

For example:

    // Wait until map is loaded
    function mapLoaded(window) {
      return window.document.querySelector("#map");
    }
    browser.wait(mapLoaded, function() {
      // Page has a #map element now

    })

Even with completion function, the browser won't wait forever.  It will complete as soon as it determines there are no
more events to wait for, or after 5 seconds of waiting.

You can also call `wait` with no callback and simply listen to the `done` and `error` events getting fired.

### Event: 'done'
`function (browser) { }`

Emitted whenever the event queue goes back to empty.

### Event: 'error'
`function (error) { }`

Emitted if an error occurred loading a page or submitting a form.

### Event: 'loaded'
`function (browser) { }`

Emitted whenever new page loaded.  This event is emitted before `DOMContentLoaded`.


## Debugging

When trouble strikes, refer to these functions and the [troubleshooting guide](troubleshoot).

### browser.dump()

Dump information to the console: Zombie version, current URL, history, cookies, event loop, etc.  Useful for debugging
and submitting error reports.

### browser.lastError : Object

Returns the last error received by this browser in lieu of response.

### browser.lastRequest : Object

Returns the last request sent by this browser.

### browser.lastResponse : Object
 
Returns the last response received by this browser.

### browser.log(arguments)
### browser.log(function)

Call with multiple arguments to spit them out to the console when debugging enabled (same as `console.log`).  Call with
function to spit out the result of that function call when debugging enabled.

### browser.resources : Object

Returns a list of resources loaded by the browser.

### browser.viewInBrowser(name?)

Views the current document in a real Web browser.  Uses the default system browser on OS X, BSD and Linux.  Probably
errors on Windows.
